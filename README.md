# 3D Printed Torsen Differential

## Overview

This project features a 3D printed model of a Torsen differential, a type of limited-slip differential used in automotive applications to improve traction. The model is designed for educational purposes, allowing enthusiasts and students to explore the mechanics and functionality of a Torsen differential through a hands-on approach.

## Introduction

The Torsen differential, also known as a torque-sensing differential, is a type of gear-based limited-slip differential that can automatically distribute torque between the drive wheels. This 3D printed model replicates the internal gearing mechanism, allowing users to visually understand how torque is managed and transferred in real-world applications.

## Components

The project includes the following components:

- **Main Housing:** The outer casing of the differential with the big bevel gear.
- **End Cap:** Secure the assembly and provide structural support.
- **Sun Gears:** Two central gears that connect to the drive shafts.
- **Planet Gears:** Multiple small worm gears with spur gears at each end that distribute torque between the sun gears.
- **Bevel Gear:** transports the torque to the differential.
- **Stand:** Holds the whole assembly.
- **Stopper:** Holds the bevel gear in place.
- **Wheels:** (optional) to stop the output shafts.
-
- **3 608 bearings:** 8x22x7 mm.
- **3 M4 screws:** 15-40 mm in length (recomended countersunk screw minimum 20mm in leangth).
- **12 M5 screws:** 20 mm in leangth (I used one 20mm screw and one 25mm screw for each planet gear).
- **7 M3 nuts**
- **7 M3 grub screws:** recomended at least 6mm, smaller ones might fall out.
- **3 Aluminium rods:** 8 mm in diameter. 85, 75 and 93 mm in leangth (doesn't really matter, but by using this dimentions they will have the perfect leangth and stick out equally)

## Requirements

- **3D Printer:** Capable of printing the required components.
- **Filament:** PLA, ABS, or any preferred filament material.
- **Lubricant:** Essential, because of the tight tolerances. Without it the operation wont be smooth (I just used WD-40).
- **Assembly Tools:** Basic tools such as screwdrivers and sandpaper.
- **3D Modeling Software:** (Optional) For modifying the original design files.

## Installation

1. **Download the Files:**
   - Download from thingiverse or the `parts_torsen` ZIP file.
     ```sh
     https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6671252
     ```

2. **Prepare for Printing:**
   - Open the `.stl` or `.3mf` files in your preferred slicing software.
   - Adjust print settings according to your printer and filament specifications IMPORTANT.

3. **Print the Components:**
   - Print all the parts individually. Ensure each part is printed accurately for proper assembly.
   - ***IMPORTANT:*** First print a couple of parts to ensure proper tolerances and adjust the horizontal expansion.
     This was printed on an old printer, so the fit might be too loose.

4. **Assemble the Model:**
   - Follow the assembly instructions provided in the `assembly_guide_torsen.pdf` included in the repository.
