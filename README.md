Introduction
The Torsen differential, also known as a torque-sensing differential, is a type of gear-based limited-slip differential that can automatically distribute torque between the drive wheels. This 3D printed model replicates the internal gearing mechanism, allowing users to visually understand how torque is managed and transferred in real-world applications.

Features
Accurate Representation: Detailed and accurate model of a Torsen differential.
Educational: Ideal for teaching and learning purposes.
Interactive: Allows hands-on exploration of differential mechanics.
Customizable: The 3D model can be modified to suit different educational needs or demonstrations.
Components
The project includes the following components:

Main Housing: The outer casing of the differential.
Sun Gears: Two central gears that connect to the drive shafts.
Planet Gears: Multiple small gears that distribute torque between the sun gears.
Carrier: Holds the planet gears in place within the housing.
End Caps: Secure the assembly and provide structural support.
Requirements
3D Printer: Capable of printing the required components.
Filament: PLA, ABS, or any preferred filament material.
3D Modeling Software: (Optional) For modifying the original design files.
Assembly Tools: Basic tools such as screwdrivers, sandpaper, and glue.
Installation
Download the Files:

Clone the repository or download the ZIP file.
sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3d-printed-torsen-differential.git
Prepare for Printing:

Open the .stl files in your preferred slicing software.
